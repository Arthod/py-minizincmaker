# Parameters
# BIBD generation is described in most standard textbooks on combinatorics. 
# A BIBD is defined as an arrangement of v  distinct objects into b blocks 
# such that each block contains exactly k distinct objects, each object 
# occurs in exactly r different blocks, and every two distinct objects 
# occur together in exactly Î» blocks.
